Master Device Control UI (Raspberry Pi Ver.)üìù OverviewThis document provides instructions for the web-based user interface designed for the precise control and monitoring of a dual-arm master device powered by a Raspberry Pi and a U2D2.All communication between this UI, the master device, and the slave robot is built on gRPC, ensuring fast and stable data exchange.üöÄ Installation and Setup1. Clone the RepositoryFirst, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Neuromeka-MasterDevice.git](https://github.com/your-username/Neuromeka-MasterDevice.git)
cd Neuromeka-MasterDevice/masterdevice_raspi_ver
(Note: Replace your-username with the actual GitHub username or organization.)2. Install DependenciesInstall the required Python packages. If a requirements.txt file is provided, use it.pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Network ConfigurationFor the UI to communicate with the Raspberry Pi, your PC must be on the same network.The PC running the UI must have an IP address that starts with 192.168.0.x.For a seamless setup without any changes, set your PC's IP address to 192.168.0.4. This allows the UI to connect to the default device IPs without any modifications.4. Run the ApplicationOnce the network is configured, run the UI by executing the app.py script:python app.py
After running the command, open a web browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050).üìñ How to UseStep 1: Connect to the DeviceWhen you first launch the application, the connection page will appear.Master Device gRPC Target: Enter the IP address and Port for the master device (Raspberry Pi).Default: 192.168.0.43:50051Slave Robot gRPC Target: Enter the IP address and Port for the slave robot that will receive the control data.Default: 192.168.0.41:50054Connect: Click the '‚ö° Connect' button. Upon a successful gRPC connection, you will be automatically redirected to the main control UI.Step 2: Main Control InterfaceThis screen is where you operate all functions of the master device.Data Streaming:Click 'Start Streaming' to begin sending data to the slave robot. The status indicator will turn green ('Active').Click 'Stop Streaming' to halt the data stream.Real-time Operation:Arm Status: The status panels for each arm show whether it is in 'Position Control' (green) or 'Gravity Compensation' (red) mode.Torque Mode: Adjust the intensity of the gravity compensation. You can set a precise value between 0.0 and 1.0 using the input field or slider.Go Home: Click the 'Go Home' button to move the robot to its predefined home position.Data Recording:Recording: Click this button to start logging encoder data. The button will change to 'Stop'; click it again to pause.Clear: Deletes all currently recorded data from memory.Save As: Saves the recorded data to a new .csv file in the project's log directory.
